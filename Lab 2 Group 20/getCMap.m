function [cmap] = getCMap(map, robot)
% GETCMAP calculates an occupancy grid in 3D C space based on a map object
%   defining obstacles in cartesian space. Effectively, this function turns
%   a cartesian space map into a configuration space map.
%
% INPUTS
%   map  - a map struct containing a 1x6 boundary field defining the
%           boundaries of the space and an Nx6 obstacles array where each 
%           row defines an axis aligned bounding box (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2). 
%           This struct is produced by the loadMap function.
%   robot - a struct containing the dimensions and joint limits of the
%           Lynx. This is stored in robot.mat.
%
% * You should make sure that the above inputs contain the following
%   fields:
%
%   map.res_th123 - a 3x1 vector defining the resolution for theta1, 
%                   theta2, and theta3.
%   robot.mrgn    - the safety margin for contact between the Lynx and any
%                   obstacles.
%
% OUTPUTS
%   cmap - an equivalent map structure for c space, containing an occupancy
%           grid that can be used for graph searches.
%           cmap should have the following fields:
%
%       cmap.occgrid     - a 3D matrix containing 1 for occupied voxels and
%                           0 for free voxels. Note that the indexing is
%                           th1,th2,th3.
%       cmap.bound_th123 - 1x6 containing lower bounds for th1, th2, th3
%                           and then upper bounds for th1, th2, th3.
%       cmap.res_th123   - 1x3 containing the resolution for th1, th2, th3
%       cmap.res_th12    - 1x2 containing the resolution for th1, th2
%       cmap.res_th3     - 1x1 containing the resolution for th3
%       cmap.mrgn        - 1x1 containing the margin of safety for the Lynx
%                           (in mm).
