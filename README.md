This reppsitory contains codes implemented on a lynx robot shown in the figure below. ![lynx robot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e23y1.png)  
## Lab 1
Calculate forward kinematic and inverse kinematic of the lynx robot.  
## Lab 2
Implement 6-D RRT on a lynx robot to achieve a goal in different 3D environment with obstacles.
## Lab 3
Implement potential field on a lynx robot to achieve a goal in different 3D environment with obstacles.
## Final
Implement RRT,RRT* and RRT* smart in a 2D environment with obstacles to optimize the path. RRT* make the path asymmptotic to the optimized path but it takes long to converge. RRT* smart largely improve the performance of RRT*.
